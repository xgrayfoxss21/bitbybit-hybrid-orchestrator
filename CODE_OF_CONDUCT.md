## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code, and to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

* Links, screenshots, or other relevant context

We will respect confidentiality requests to protect reporters.
